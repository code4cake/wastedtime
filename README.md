# Wasted Time  ü§∑‚Äç ? 
A tool for the reclusive introvert, the productivity zealot, the time police officer, or just the person who wants to quantify information about how his/her time is generally spent.

Do you relate to one or more of the following scenarios...

- Do you keep telling yourself: "Geez, I spend too much time in meetings I can't get anything done ?
- Does your project owner, scrum master, spouse/ significant other is always telling you "we need to talk", or "we need to have a meeting" ?
- Does your time seems to fly out of your hands because you're always on "meetings" ?
- Do you feel like you cannot üí© in peace cause you are always taking care of some other stuff ?
- Have you actually ever wanted to know how much of your time is spend on "meetings" versus all the other important stuff you pretend to be doing ?

If you answer "yes" to any of these questions then this simple cli if for you. This little tool will tell you what's the percentage of time spent on unnecessary stuff versus actually doing what really matters.

Next time your significant other, gardener, dog, friend, manager, family member wants to take you away from the actual "important stuff" you think you are doing. Just run this and say:

- No hon, 15% of our available time was spent on having sex last week. No more coitus until at least next week.
- No man, I cannot hang out with you tonight, cause I have allocated more than 70% of my time just "hanging out" with you.
- Geez buddy, I would like to play with you tonight (masturbate tonight), but it seems that I have given you 80% of my time this week. Maybe on saturday? 

Now you can go and feel entitled to go and do what REALLY MATTERS in your life.
